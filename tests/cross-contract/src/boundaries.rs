//! Failures at each cross-contract read boundary.
//!
//! The table in [`crate::harness`] numbers the three reads `register_proof`
//! performs. This module walks that table: for each boundary it drives a
//! failure *before* it, *inside* it, and *after* it, and asserts the same thing
//! every time — the invocation is rejected, it publishes nothing, and the
//! complete footprint is exactly what it was beforehand.
//!
//! "Inside" is the case that needs help from [`crate::mocks`]. The real
//! dependencies never fail a read: `is_paused`, `is_schema_version_approved`
//! and `is_active_address` all answer successfully whatever their state and
//! report their verdict in the returned `bool`. A substitute dependency is the
//! only way to make the read itself fail, and it is also what makes the
//! *ordering* of the steps observable: a dependency that rejects every call
//! turns "which check ran first" into an assertion rather than a claim.
