# Testing

This document describes how to run and extend the EarnProof test suite, and how
the bounded mutation-testing profile protects the authorization and validation
controls of the on-chain contracts.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain from `rust-toolchain.toml` (`stable` + `rustfmt` + `clippy`).
- No running node, network, or local ledger is required for the Rust suites.

## Unit and integration tests

The workspace test suite spans the in-contract unit tests (`.src/lib.rs` under
`contracts/`) and the scenario-based integration suites under `tests/`:

| Suite | Crate | Covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `emergency-tests` | `tests/emergency` | pause matrix, admin rotation, revocation and recovery sequences |
| `cross-contract-tests` | `tests/cross-contract` | cross-contract boundaries, races, and references |
| `event-tests` | `tests/events` | event emission, ordering, and compatibility |
| `resource-budget-tests` | `tests/budgets` | Soroban resource (CPU/memory) budgets |

Run everything:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

Run a single suite:

```bash
cargo test -p emergency-tests
```

## Formatting, linting, and building

These are the checks CI runs on every pull request:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
cargo test --workspace
cargo build --workspace
```

## Mutation testing

A green suite can still miss a removed `require_auth`, an inverted status check,
or a skipped expiry check. Mutation testing injects those bugs and asks the
suite to catch them.

The **bounded profile** in [`.cargo/mutants.toml`](../.cargo/mutants.toml)
limits mutation to `contracts/**/src/lib.rs` — the authorization and validation
branches listed in [`tests/mutation/README.md`](../tests/mutation/README.md) —
and runs the whole workspace suite against every mutant.

Run the profile and enforce the reviewed score:

```powershell
.\scripts\mutation-test.ps1
```

Prove the gate catches the seeded "removed authorization" and "inverted validity
check" mutations:

```powershell
.\scripts\mutation-test.ps1 -SelfTest
```

### Score policy

The reviewed policy is **zero missed mutants** in the bounded set. `cargo mutants`
exits non-zero when any mutant survives, and `mutation-test.ps1` additionally
computes the score from `mutants.out/outcomes.json` and fails if it drops below
`-MinimumScore` (default `100`).

When a mutant survives:

1. Inspect the exact change in `mutants.out/diff/`.
2. Add a test that asserts the correct behaviour at the right abstraction level
   (preferably through a public entry point), or
3. Explicitly justify the survivor in the PR — e.g. the mutant is behaviourally
   indistinguishable from the correct code.

### CI enforcement

The `mutation` job in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)
runs the bounded profile and the seeded-mutation self-test on a weekly schedule
and on `workflow_dispatch`, and uploads `mutants.out/` as an artifact. It is
deliberately not part of the fast PR loop so the normal contributor test cycle
stays quick.

### Reproducibility

- `cargo-mutants` is pinned to `27.1.0` and installed with `--locked`.
- `mutants.out/` and `mutants.out.old/` are git-ignored; `outcomes.json` records
  the per-mutant verdicts and the summary used to compute the score.
# Testing and coverage

What CI runs, what coverage measures, and what's deliberately excluded (#66).

## What CI runs

Every PR touching the workspace runs (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `contracts`
job): `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`,
`cargo test --workspace`, `cargo build --workspace`.

A separate `coverage` job runs `cargo-llvm-cov` (pinned to `0.8.7` — see the
workflow file for why an unpinned install isn't used), generates both a
human-readable summary and a machine-readable JSON report, checks the
critical-path gates below, and uploads both files as a build artifact
(`coverage-report`, 30-day retention). No source code, secrets, or coverage
data leave GitHub Actions — nothing is uploaded to an external coverage
service.

## Running coverage locally

```bash
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov --version 0.8.7 --locked
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only
```

Add `--html` for a browsable per-line report, or `--json --output-path
coverage.json` to reproduce exactly what CI checks.

## Critical-path gates

`scripts/check-coverage-gates.py` reads the JSON report and fails if any
contract's **region** coverage — the metric that catches an untested branch a
line- or function-level number can miss — drops below its gate:

| File | Minimum | Measured when introduced |
|---|---|---|
| `contracts/issuer-registry/src/lib.rs` | 90.0% | 98.77% |
| `contracts/proof-registry/src/lib.rs` | 90.0% | 98.61% |
| `contracts/protocol-config/src/lib.rs` | 90.0% | 97.51% |

Minimums are set below the measured figure at introduction, not at it — an
unrelated one-line change to an already-well-tested branch shouldn't fail CI
over noise, while an actual regression (new logic added with no test
reaching it) still gets caught. Each contract's real coverage is already
close to complete: the specific 1-11 missed regions per file are almost
entirely defensive `unreachable!()`/internal-invariant branches that
`mock_all_auths()`-based tests can't reach without deliberately corrupting
storage first — see the `#[cfg(test)]` module in each contract for what
*is* covered (initialization, every state transition, every documented
error path, TTL renewal, event emission).

Authorization, validation, state-mutation, and error branches are exercised
directly: every `require_auth` call site has a test asserting the exact
address it demands (see `contracts/issuer-registry/src/lib.rs`'s
`revoke_issuer_rejects_a_valid_signature_from_the_issuer_itself` for the
pattern, and `tests/emergency/src/admin_rotation.rs`'s
`assert_authorized_by` helper for scoped-auth assertions against the real
invocation tree rather than a blanket `mock_all_auths()`), every documented
error variant in `earnproof_shared::{ContractError, IssuerError, ProofError}`
has a test that triggers it, and every state-changing entry point has a
paired "emits exactly one event" / "emits no event on rejection" assertion
(see [`docs/events.md`](./events.md)).

## What's excluded, and why

**`packages/shared/src/lib.rs`** is excluded from the gates above (not from
the report — it still appears in the summary, at whatever llvm-cov measures
for it). It contains only `#[contracterror]`/`#[contracttype]` declarations
and constants — zero `pub fn` or `impl` blocks of its own — so there is no
executable logic for llvm-cov to attribute coverage to directly. The
derive-macro-generated (de)serialization code these types produce *is*
exercised, but only observably through the three contracts that use them,
which is exactly what the three gates above already measure.

**Generated client bindings** (the `*Client` structs `#[contractimpl]`
generates) and **host glue code** are not separately gated for the same
reason: they have no logic of their own to regress independently of the
contract method they wrap.

## Test layout

- `contracts/*/src/lib.rs` — unit tests per contract, in an inline
  `#[cfg(test)] mod test`, using `env.mock_all_auths()` for the majority of
  behavioral coverage.
- `tests/cross-contract/` — cross-contract wiring, using scoped `MockAuth`/
  `MockAuthInvoke` (see [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](./troubleshooting.md#authorization-failures)
  for the authorization-scoping concepts these tests exercise).
- `tests/emergency/`, `tests/budgets/`, `tests/events/`, `tests/time/`,
  `tests/encoding/`, `tests/event-fixtures/` — one workspace member per
  concern, each independently coverage-measured but not separately gated
  (they exercise the same three contracts the gates above already cover).
